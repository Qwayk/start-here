# Proof / demo — safety model in action

This is a lightweight proof artifact for the “safe-by-default” model.

Goal: show (truthfully) what someone should expect:

1) Dry-run produces a deterministic plan
2) Apply requires explicit flags
3) Results are verified via read-back
4) A receipt artifact is produced for auditing

## Demo (what to include)

- 3 screenshots (or short terminal snippets):
  - a dry-run plan
  - the apply command (with flags)
  - the read-back verification output
- Link to a receipt artifact (or a sanitized sample)

## What this is / isn’t

Is:
- CLI tools + workflow packs designed for safe automation via APIs
- self-serve documentation and repeatable patterns

Isn’t:
- an agent that holds your credentials
- a done-for-you service
- an SLA-backed support plan
