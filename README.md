# Qwayk — safe-by-default API tools for AI agents

If you want an AI agent to do real actions for you (through APIs), but you don’t want it to “just do things” and break stuff, this is for you.

I’m building a library of small tools that are designed for **safe automation**.

## The idea (simple)

Most “agent demos” skip the boring part: safety.

Here’s the rule I follow:
1) show you the plan first (dry-run)
2) only do the write when you explicitly say apply
3) verify what happened (read-back)
4) write a receipt so you can audit it later

## What you can do (examples)

- publish/update content safely (Ghost / WordPress)
- pull marketing/analytics data without guessing (Plausible / Ads APIs)
- manage infrastructure/vendor accounts carefully (Cloudflare / Statuspage / Dynadot)

## Proof + tools list

Start here:
- Proof/demo: `https://github.com/Qwayk/start-here/blob/main/PROOF.md`
- Tool catalog (what exists today): `TOOLS.md`

If you’re thinking “ok but what am I paying for?” — open `TOOLS.md` first.

## Membership (what you get)

We sell membership via GitHub Sponsors:
- Sponsors page: `https://github.com/sponsors/Qwayk`
- Members get access to the private members repo: `Qwayk/qwayk-tools` (private)

If the Sponsors page isn’t live yet, we’re likely in the approval/onboarding flow.

Members repo includes:
- onboarding that’s actually usable (`START_HERE.md`)
- workflow packs (the “do this outcome” playbooks)
- updates and early drops

If you’re a vibe coder:
- you can treat the workflow packs like “copy/paste recipes”.
- run dry-run first, then apply only when it looks right.

## Support boundary (important, so we don’t waste each other’s time)

This is built to be self-serve:
- No custom setup
- No SLAs
- Don’t paste secrets into Issues/Discussions

## Where to start

1) Read `PROOF.md`.
2) Skim `TOOLS.md` (it tells you what exists and what’s coming).
3) If it matches what you want, sponsor and accept the GitHub invite.
