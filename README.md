# Safe-by-default API tools for AI agents

This repo is the **front door** for a library of API tools designed for AI agents and automation.

Core principle: safety-first defaults
- **Dry-run by default**
- Writes require explicit **apply**
- We produce **receipts/audit logs** so changes are verifiable

Proof/demo (start here): `https://qwayk.com/trust/`

## What you can do with these tools

Examples:
- publish/update content safely (CMS APIs)
- run marketing/analytics reads safely (ad + analytics APIs)
- manage infra/vendor accounts safely (cloud + status + registrar APIs)

The tools live here: `https://qwayk.com/tools/`

## Get access (membership)

We sell membership via GitHub Sponsors:
- Sponsors page: `https://qwayk.com/get-access/`
- Members get access to the private members repo: `Qwayk/qwayk-tools`

Members repo includes:
- self-serve onboarding (`START_HERE.md`)
- workflow packs
- updates/releases
- strict support boundaries (docs-first; no custom setup by default)

## Support boundary (important)

This is built to be self-serve:
- No custom setup
- No SLAs
- Don’t paste secrets into Issues/Discussions

## Contributing / open source

Some parts may be open source; some “workflow packs” may be sponsor-only.
If you want to support the work, sponsor here: `https://qwayk.com/get-access/`.
